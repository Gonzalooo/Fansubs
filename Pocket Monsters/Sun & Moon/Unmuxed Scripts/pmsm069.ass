Splitting the line in two is also not really feasible given how fast he talks, and putting the TL note BELOW the line would make it a three-liner... Point being, there is no possible way for this line not to be an eyesore. I think what we have right now is the least eyesore option. -Starfish OF THE FUTURE}

Large amount of changes for virtually every episode. General overview:  
-Updated monster and move names to those used in later Pocket Monsters projects, and updated some lines accordingly.  
-Updated styling to that used in later Pocket Monsters projects.  
-Corrected errors brought to our attention.

The changes here are largely automatic, although checked by hand. I intend to rewatch the series eventually to fix up any issues that I didn't catch, and probably make some more misc changes. Some moves have also not been changed yet because we haven't settled on handlings for them. No muxed subs until these things are sorted out. In the meantime, if you wish to download the unmuxed scripts, please install the fonts contained within the zip in this directory.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.40,0:18:40.32,Duel Songs EN,,0,0,0,,Two opposites infinitely reflect one another {My take is a bit different. Look up infinity mirror for the visual image of what we’re talking about. “a configuration of two or more parallel or nearly parallel mirrors, creating a series of smaller and smaller reflections that appear to recede to infinity” This is why we have opposition and twins. Things gradually revealed by these infinite mirrors: Juri’s desire, shiori’s fickle cruelty, the falseness of all involved relationships which were built on lies. The jp website with interpretations of these interprets the song in light of some bullshit like the earth is split into men and women, so humanity is imperfect or some shit, but I really don't agree this has anything to do with that. Or at least not in the context of this anime. These songs were written about something else originally after all, but here it's really hard to argue that this isn't about Juri being a lesbian.}

A concept that includes a thorough knowledge of gold materials, operating procedures, and principles. More practically, also usually a round crucible, in which ingredients are placed and heated in alchemy.The egg is considered perfect because it alone gives rise to a living organism. Anything can happen from the perfect philosophical egg. In particular, generating gold, which is a perfect metal, proves that you have obtained the egg of philosophy.}
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.28,0:19:06.88,Duel Songs EN,,0,0,89,,Origin in that which is nested{in the jp notes ireko setsu (nesting theory) is mentioned as something that's been around since ancient greece. When I tried investigating ireko setsu I found a few results for zensei setsu which mention ireko inside the article. So I read about zensei setsu or preformationism in english. Look it up, but basically it's the belief that organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves, e.g. sperm is a tiny man that somehow becomes you? or your descendants? Anyway. So ireko is basically a thing that goes into another thing (like matryoshka dolls, or ever smaller boxes inside each other). And preformationism logically leads to the idea that in each organism there is an inifinite chain of ever smaller organisms, which are themselves? or their descendants? or both? This seems to be connected to homunculi somehow as well. I guess coz tiny men? So all of this is to say that, this line - in nesting lies the origin, is perhaps the answer to the question of: what came first - the chicken or the egg? Which I guess loses its meaning if the egg and the chicken are an infinite chain or ever smaller versions of the same thing.}

Did I have the wrong impression? Is the sentiment of this line more like "Well, it's a shame she doesn't appreciate him. Would be nice if she did..."? - Toa}{the kedo at the end casts doubt on Utena's hope, so "I guess I just" should convey that much. However, mukuwareru is a bit tricky. That's not appreciate - it could be reciprocate, pay off, reward, recompense, get even. This is applied to feelings/thoughts - omoi. So omoi ga mukuwareru - is like feelings pay off, but that's not something you'd say in English. If he was pursuing her romantically then I'd go for "I hope his feelings are reciprocated". If they were not then "I hope his thoughts aren't for nothing". Since it's left ambiguous what Utena wishes for I'd maybe go with "...hope something good comes of it".}{How does this sound? - Toa}

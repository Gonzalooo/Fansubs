Seeing as there's the double meaning of yuri, the lily needs to be preserved. The only English expression I know with the word "lily" in it is "lily-livered" which means the opposite of what they're going for here. For now, I'm going with a modified version of what the official TL had. - Toa}{Suggestions: Walking as ellegantly as a lily sways. The sway of a Lesbos lily in her step. Gilding a Lesbos lilly. This saying seems irrelevant, it's a fragment, I have no clue what they're trying to say. Maybe they're talking about Utena. To gild a lily is a phrase that is also about beauty and has nothing to do with this, so why not use that? Lily doesn't really have lesbian connotations in the west among non anime fans, so include Lesbos, the island, if you want to be more obvious. Lesbos lily is also alliterative so it sounds nice.}

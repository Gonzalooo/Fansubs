When? Where? Who? Which?					When? Where? Who? Which?
When? Where? Who? Which?					When? Where? Who? Which?
A bloodstream held by the cage of memory,			kioku no ori no chi no nagare
cradled in a thousand years of bliss				sennen shifuku no yurikago no
I am an actor, eternal metaphors				watashi wa haiyuu tatoete eikyuu
A desertâ€™s wintry Sphinx, Phinx					sabaku no fuyu no sufinku-su-finkusu
Of the flesh that is born and dies,				tanjou shibou no nikutai no
the sad winds tell you						kanashiki kaze wo kimi shiru ya
The holy actor, eternal metaphors				seinaru haiyuu tatoete eikyuu
Margineaux of light and dark, fallen down to hell		naraku he ochita aninkou marujinoo
Brightly burn!							hikare moeyo
Awaken and sing!						samete utae
Born into the world, born into an instant			sekai ni tanjou shunkan tanjou
An endless cycle!						sono kurikaeshi
